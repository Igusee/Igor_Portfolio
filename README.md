# Welcome to Igor's Portfolio
I'm Igor. I hold a Bachelor's in Global Business Services with a minor in Data Analysis, currently I am pursuing a Master's degree in Project Management at Cracow University of Economics. I also have over three years of internship experience at ABB in Controlling & Purchasing and Administration. Below are some of my Data Analysis Projects, that I made in my free time or for my classes or for my classes.

# [Project 1: HR data Cleaning in SQL and Power BI Analysis and Visualisation](https://github.com/Igusee/Project-HR-Data)
## Power BI and MySQL Project aimed at Visulisation and Analysis of HR data (Click the headline above for more details)
* Utilized HR data for analysis.
* Performed basic cleaning and minor adjustments in MySQL to prepare the data for analysis.
* Analyzed and visualized data in Power BI.
* The dashboard presents insights on:
  * Gender distribution across the company.
  * Race distribution across the company.
  * Age distribution across the company.
  * Preferred workplace locations.
  * Other notable patterns.

# [Project 2: Real Estate Price Regression in R](https://github.com/Igusee/Project-Wroclaw-housing-costs-Regression-Model)
## RStudio Assignment Project for my "Regression models in Business Analytics classes" at University. (Click the headline above for more details)
* Developed a regression model to predict apartment prices in Wrocław.
* Analyzed data from **Otodom** to explore key factors influencing apartment prices.
* Key dataset variables included:
  * **Building Age**: Years since construction, indicating infrastructure wear.
  * **Distance from City Center**: Kilometers from Wrocław’s main square.
  * **Apartment Size**: Measured in square meters, representing livable space.
* Insights derived from model analysis:
  * Negative linear relationship between price and both building age and distance from the center.
  * Positive linear relationship between price and apartment size.
* Evaluated model accuracy through residual diagnostics, correlation analysis, and independence tests:
  * Identified and excluded outliers for improved precision.
  * Chose the best-fit model after comparing several variations based on adjusted R² and statistical significance.
* Estimated prices for hypothetical apartments to demonstrate model applicability.
* Visualizations created using R include:
  * Scatter plots with regression lines.
  * Residual and quantile-quantile plots for diagnostic purposes.

# [Project 3: Apartment Data Visualization in R and Flexdashboard](https://github.com/Igusee/Project-Apartment-Data-Visualization-in-R-and-Flexdashboard)  
## RStudio FlexDashboard Assignment project for "Data Visualisation" Classes. (Click the headline above for more details)

* Utilized apartment data from Wrocław for analysis and visualization.  
* Loaded and prepared data from Excel for analysis.  
* Created various visualizations using ggplot2, plotly, and other R libraries.  
* Developed an interactive Flexdashboard to present key insights.  
* The dashboard presents insights on:  
  * Price vs. years of use of apartments.  
  * Price vs. distance from the city center.  
  * Correlations among apartment attributes (e.g., size, price, distance).  
  * 3D visualizations of apartment data.  
  * Interactive data tables for apartment details.
